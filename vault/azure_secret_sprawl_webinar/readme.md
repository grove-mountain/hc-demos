# Eliminating Secret Sprawl with Vault on Azure

The main purpose of this webinar was to demonstrate how to eliminate secret sprawl with Vault.   Basic K/V demo was used locally, and then patterns for Azure Auth login via MSI assigned to the image were used for these examples.

Azure resources were launched using Terraform code at: https://github.com/grove-mountain/azure-terraform-vault-workshop.git.   This is a fork of Sean Carolan's excellent work located at https://github.com/scarolan/azure-terraform-vault-workshop.   It's been modified to add in Service Principals for doing Azure Auth into Vault.
